Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the array occurs twice. how would you determine which value occurs twice? write a method that will find and return the duplicate value that is know to be in the array. 

create an array that contains only the unique elements from input array. 
compare the array of unique elements with the input array and return the only element from the input array that does not exist in the array of unique elements.
